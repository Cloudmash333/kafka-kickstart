# Quickstart

```bash
pip install kafka-python
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure Docker is running Kafka (docker-compose up -d).

Start the consumer:

```bash
python consumer.py
```

Then run the producer in a separate terminal:

```bash
python producer.py
```

## Optional 
You can check Kafka logs using:

```bash
docker-compose logs kafka
```

To list topics:

```bash
docker exec -it <kafka-container-id> kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

## How to Stop Kafka + Zookeeper Containers

Since you're using Docker Compose, the clean way is:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

What this does:
Stops all containers defined in your docker-compose.yml.

Removes the containers (but not the images, volumes, or networks unless specified).

If you just want to stop them without removing, use:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

## üîÑ How to Start / Restart

## ‚úÖ To start again after down:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

It will recreate the containers and start them in detached mode.

## üîÅ To restart (like a reboot):

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

This is useful if you changed some environment variables or configs in the YAML and want to restart without stopping everything manually.
